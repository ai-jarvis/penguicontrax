          <p>We limit Wouldattends because they influence our schedule. Our algorithm tries
          as hard as it can to prevent the events you Wouldattend from being in the same
          timeslot. Currently, it takes days or weeks for a computer to run the process. A
          person who Wouldattend everything is no different from having no preferences at
          all-- and would burden the system.</p>

          <p>Eventually you'll be able to make an itinerary, and that will be unlimited. In
          your itinerary, you can even pretend you have a time turner and clone yourself in
          multiple places at once. But that feature will only be available after everything
          is put into a time slot.</p>

          <p>So why shall Wouldattends be four, neither shall it be six? (And seven is
          right out?)</p>

          <p>There are only forty-eight timeslots from 4PM Friday until 4PM Sunday. A human
          being who needs sleep might attend sixteen-- that's four on Friday, eight on
          Saturday, and four on Sunday, and then when would you eat? Realistically, a
          marathon Penguicon attendee (such as yourself) will attend ten events. The
          majority will attend eight or fewer.</p>

          <p>There will probably only be five which you will remember for years to
          come.</p>

          <p>For most events, if they overlap and you have to miss one, that's no big deal.
          However, there are some really special events which, if I miss one because
          they're scheduled at the same time, I would gnash my teeth, rend my raiments, and
          cry unto the heavens. The five Wouldattends represent those true gems. Our
          algorithm should only try to protect those for you.</p>

          <p>Version 2.0 of the site will allow anyone to work for Penguicon by
          proofreading. If those proofreads are accepted by staff users, the system will
          award the proofreader with more Wouldattends! The Conchair would also have power
          to reward anyone with Wouldattends for doing something special for the
          convention.</p>

        <h4 id="whytuxtrax">Q. Why did Penguicon make its own scheduling software?</h4>

        <div class="col-md-1">
          A.
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-11">
          <blockquote>
          <p>It's difficult to find scheduling systems that support our needs. Penguicon's
          schedule is managed by multiple staff, because it's multiple conventions in one.
          Our suggestion form is different if you're running a board game, performing a
          concert, or leading a workshop. We also needed to integrate our event suggestion
          system with the system that algorithmically turns events into a schedule free of
          conflicts.</p>

          <p>For years, Penguicon planned the schedule using two systems, and kept them in
          sync manually. In a spreadsheet, we represented rooms as columns, and times as
          rows, so we could catch conflicts. But it didn't store the event description, the
          topics, whether or not it is "just an idea"/"probably happening"/"confirmed", and
          other important data. We used a database to store and present a schedule with all
          the details associated with each event. But the databases we have used could not
          catch conflicts in which two events are scheduled in the same room at the same
          time, or a presenter in two places at one time, or duplicated events or
          presenters. Tuxtrax stores all the data we use, and also alerts us to conflicts,
          instead of duplicating the data in two systems.</p>

          <p>It takes a lot of work to format a schedule into a printable schedule book.
          All too often, no proofreading is done until we see a PDF of the book. That means
          the desktop publishing person receives a corrected version of the schedule (or
          worse, receives a list of individual edits and has to edit them by hand) and has
          to re-do a lot of work. During the months before the publishing deadline, the
          proofreading should be done online. Eventually Tuxtrax will allow this. The
          public will be able to see the work in progress and suggest edits. The Penguicon
          staff will be able to click "approve" to accept each edit.</p>

          <p>It's great to show our work to the public while it happens, to maintain
          excitement throughout the year.</p>
